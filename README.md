# Firewalls, Cybersecurity, and Automation in the Cloud

This code is old and was used to demonstrate concepts related to security automation in the early days of serious cloud usage.
It was written for a SANS paper to show people how automation could be leveraged in cloud environments back in about 2018.
I no longer use this product.
I recommend checking out the 2sl-jobexecframework repository for more up to date automation in cloud environments.
